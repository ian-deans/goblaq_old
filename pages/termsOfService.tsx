                Advertising. GOBLAQ and its licensees may publicly display
                advertisements, paid content, and other information nearby or in
                association with Your Content. You are not entitled to any

                Other. User Content (including any that may have been created by
                users employed or contracted by GOBLAQ) does not necessarily
                reflect the opinion of GOBLAQ. Except as required by law, we
                have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your
                Content, and we do not guarantee any confidentiality with
                respect to Your Content. We reserve the right to remove, screen,
                edit, or reinstate User Content at our sole discretion for any
                reason or no reason, and without notice to you. For example, we
                may remove a review if we believe it violates our Content
                Guidelines. Except in accordance with GOBLAQ’s Verified License
                program, GOBLAQ does not attempt to verify any licenses a local
                business or its representatives may have, and consumers should
                inquire about any such licenses with the business directly.
                Businesses whose licenses have been verified by GOBLAQ will have
                a “Verified License” badge displayed on their GOBLAQ business
                page.

                Generally. You can access features through the Service that

                as making restaurant or spa reservations, ordering food
                delivery, or scheduling appointments. These features may be
                provided by GOBLAQ’s third-party partners, including through
                iframes or similar formats, and their use may be governed by
                different or additional terms presented to you as part of the
                booking or transaction process. Please note that such
                third-party partners and/or the transacting local businesses
                themselves are responsible for fulfilling such bookings and
                transactions.

                fees in accordance with the transacting local business’s
                cancellation policy provided at the time of booking. You agree
                that GOBLAQ may facilitate any such payments and charges on
                behalf of the transacting local business.

                required by law), not redeemable for cash or any other
                consideration, and automatically expire thirty (30) days after
                the issue date unless otherwise specified. If your Account is
                terminated you will not be able to use any unexpired and unused
                coupons, and any such coupons will automatically terminate and
                cannot be redeemed unless required by law.{' '}

                  are governed by those terms), or a breach of Section 7 above
                  (Representations and Warranties). Excluded Claims may be

                  enforceability of the arbitration provision will be resolved

                  Excluded Claims and Claims that cannot be arbitrated must be

                  well as any such Excluded Claim or Claim that cannot be

                  competent jurisdiction. All other Excluded Claims and Claims
                  that cannot be arbitrated are subject to the exclusive

          <h3>ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR BUSINESS ACCOUNTS</h3>
          <strong>Last Updated on December 13, 2019.</strong>
          The following terms (<strong>“Business Terms”</strong>), in addition
          to the Terms of Service above, govern your access to and use of your
          Business Account. In the event of any conflict between these Business
          Terms and the Terms of Service, the Business Terms apply. If you have
          purchased products or services from GOBLAQ on behalf of your business
          (e.g., advertising or business tools), the terms of that purchase
          apply in the event of any conflict with these Business Terms.
          Capitalized words used but not defined in these Business Terms have
          the meanings described in the Terms of Service. By creating,
          accessing, or using your Business Account, you are agreeing to these
          Business Terms and concluding a legally binding contract with GOBLAQ.
          You are not authorized to create, access, or use a Business Account if
          you do not agree to these Business Terms.{' '}
          <strong>
            PLEASE READ THESE BUSINESS TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY REQUIRE THE USE
            OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER
            THAN TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE
            TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
          </strong>{' '}
          In the event of any termination of these Business Terms, whether by
          you or us, these Business Terms in their entirety will continue in
          full force and effect.

                  penalize consumers for posting reviews) about your Business,
                  are prohibited under Texas law (Cal. Civil Code § 1670.8) and

                  45b) and you agree that you will not include such clauses in
                  your consumer contracts, or otherwise attempt to enforce
                  non-disparagement or ‘gag’ clauses against consumers under any
                  circumstances. You understand that we may publicly notify
                  consumers, including by placing a Consumer Alert on the
                  business page for your Business, if we have a good faith
                  belief that such clauses are used by your Business.

                You understand and acknowledge that GOBLAQ allows consumers to
                post Content about your Business, including photos, ratings, and
                reviews. You understand and acknowledge that GOBLAQ employs
                automated software in an effort to showcase the most reliable
                and useful reviews while displaying other reviews less
                prominently (<strong>“Recommendation Software”</strong>). You
                understand and acknowledge that while GOBLAQ uses its
                Recommendation Software to identify potentially less helpful
                reviews, the Recommendation Software may sometimes suppress
                legitimate reviews or fail to detect illegitimate reviews. You
                understand and acknowledge that any purchase of advertising or
                other paid features from GOBLAQ will not influence the
                Recommendation Software or otherwise allow or enable You,
                directly or indirectly, to alter reviews or impact whether,
                where, or how reviews appear on GOBLAQ.

            </ol>
            <li>DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</li>
            <strong>
              PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY SINCE IT LIMITS THE LIABILITY
              OF THE GOBLAQ ENTITIES TO YOU. FOR CLARITY, THE BELOW APPLIES IN
              ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DETAILED
              IN SECTION 12 OF THE TERMS.
            </strong>
            The federal Communications Decency Act (47 U.S. Code § 230) limits
            the liability of interactive computer services, like GOBLAQ, for
            their role in publishing third-party Content, including consumer
            reviews. Additionally, anti-SLAPP laws, such as{' '}
            <a href='https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/code-of-civil-procedure/ccp-sect-425-16.html'>
              Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16
            </a>{' '}
            in Texas, may require you to pay GOBLAQ’s attorneys’ fees if you
            attempt to impose such liability on GOBLAQ through legal
            proceedings.
            <li>ARBITRATION, DISPUTES, AND CHOICE OF LAW</li>
            <strong>
              FOR CLARITY, THIS SECTION GOVERNS ANY BUSINESS CLAIM BROUGHT BY
              YOU OR GOBLAQ. ANY CLAIM NOT SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION IS INSTEAD
              GOVERNED BY SECTION 13 OF THE TERMS.
            </strong>{' '}
            Except for Excluded Business Claims, any controversy or claim
            arising out of or relating to: (a) these Terms, or the breach
            thereof; or (b) your access to or use of your Business Account
            Business Site; (each such controversy or claim, a{' '}
            <strong>“Business Claim”</strong>), shall be settled by arbitration
            administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance
            with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award
            rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
            jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will issue a reasoned award in
            writing, including all findings of fact and law upon which the award
            was made. The arbitrator will not have the power to commit errors of
            law, and the award may be vacated or corrected through judicial
            review by a court of competent jurisdiction under the Texas
            Arbitration Act for any such error.{' '}
            <strong>“Excluded Business Claims”</strong> means Claims related to
            intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks) or violations
            of Section 7 of the Terms of Service (Representations and
            Warranties). Business Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator.
            Arbitrations will be held in HOUSTON, Texas, but the parties may
            choose for themselves whether to appear in person, by phone, or
            through the submission of documents. The arbitration shall be
            governed by the laws of the State of Texas. The prevailing party
            shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees.
            NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, FOR ANY BUSINESS CLAIM THAT IS NOT
            SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION EXCLUDED
            BUSINESS CLAIMS, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND
            EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND
            FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN HOUSTON , TEXAS, WHICH IS THE PLACE OF
            PERFORMANCE OF THESE BUSINESS TERMS. YOU AND GOBLAQ AGREE THAT EACH
            MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN BUSINESS CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
            IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
            CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
            UNLESS BOTH YOU AND GOBLAQ AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
            CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE BUSINESS CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES
            WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER
            ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IF A BUSINESS
            CLAIM IMPLICATES THIS SECTION, AND THIS SECTION IS FOUND TO BE
            INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL BY A COURT, SUCH BUSINESS CLAIM
            MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.
